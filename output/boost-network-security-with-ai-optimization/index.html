                        <h2>Understanding Cybersecurity Threats</h2>

                            
                        <h3>Common Types of Cyber Threats</h3>
<p>Cyber threats are numerous and continually evolving, posing significant risks to organizations. Understanding these threats is the first step toward effective defense.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Malware and Ransomware</h3>
<p>Malware, including ransomware, is designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Ransomware specifically locks users out of their data until a ransom is paid, making it a particularly insidious threat.</p>

                            
                        <h3>Phishing Attacks</h3>
<p>Phishing attacks involve tricking individuals into providing sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, often through deceptive emails or websites. These attacks exploit human psychology and are highly effective.</p>

                            
                        <h3>DDoS Attacks</h3>
<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks overwhelm systems with traffic, rendering them unavailable to users. This can lead to significant downtime and financial losses for affected organizations.</p>

                            
                        <h3>The Evolving Landscape of Cyber Threats</h3>
